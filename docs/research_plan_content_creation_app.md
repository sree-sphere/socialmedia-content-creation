# Research Plan: Hugging Face Models and Agentic AI for Content Creation App

## Objectives
- Identify optimal Hugging Face models for text, image, and video generation.
- Research agentic AI patterns for content routing and model selection.
- Provide specific model names, APIs, and integration approaches.
- Include code examples and implementation strategies.
- Analyze performance, cost, and accessibility considerations.
- Recommend an overall system architecture.

## Research Breakdown
1.  **Hugging Face Model Research:**
    *   Text Generation Models (Content Planning & Creative Writing)
    *   Image Generation Models (Infographics & Visuals)
    *   Video Generation Models
2.  **Agentic AI Architecture Research:**
    *   Content Routing Patterns
    *   Model Selection Logic
3.  **Integration and Implementation:**
    *   APIs and Libraries
    *   Code Examples

## Key Questions
1.  What are the most performant and accessible text generation models on Hugging Face for generating creative content plans in JSON format?
2.  What are the best image generation models on Hugging Face for creating infographics and other visual content?
3.  What are the options for video generation using Hugging Face models, and what are their limitations?
4.  What are the most effective agentic AI patterns for routing different content types (text, image, video) to the appropriate generative models?
5.  How can these models be integrated into a Streamlit application? What are the specific APIs and libraries to use?
6.  What is a scalable and cost-effective system architecture for this content creation app?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: Hugging Face Hub, Hugging Face Documentation, relevant research papers and articles.
- Search strategies: Use targeted keywords on Google Scholar and the Hugging Face Hub to find models and articles related to "text generation for content planning," "image generation for infographics," "video generation models," "agentic AI for content creation," "model routing," and "multi-modal generative models."

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Minimum 3 credible sources for each key finding.
- Cross-validation: Compare information from Hugging Face model cards, research papers, and technical blogs to validate performance claims and integration methods.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive research report in markdown format.
- Actionable recommendations for building the content creation app.
- Specific model names, APIs, and code examples.
- A recommended system architecture diagram.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search-focused workflow to gather a broad range of information first, followed by a verification-focused workflow to validate the findings and recommendations.
- Justification: The task requires a comprehensive understanding of the available models and architectures before diving into the specifics of implementation.
